Tried with convolutional bases of pretrained models

VGG16 + feedforward
VGG19 + feedforward
RESNET152V2 + feedforward
DENSENET121 + feedforward
DENSENET201 + feedforward
DENSENET201 + moreconvolution + feedforward
DENSENET201 + SupportVectorClassififer (without pooling last layer)
DENSENET201 + SupportVectorClassififer (pooling last layer)


Ensemble of VGG16, DN121, DN201
Ensemble of VGG19, DN121, DN201

Did 8 fold cross validation of all the above.

8 fold cross validation of saswatnet. Not enough RAM to run sklearn nfold crossfold validation
Manually created subsets for 8fold validation of saswatnet

Tried Hyperparameter Tuning for DN201_pretrained using Bayesian Optimization. Not enough RAM.
