notes - classification models output a probability vector erroneously interpreted as model uncertainty (11:11)
A person with degree of belief p in event A is asumed to be willing to pay <= p units for a unit wager on A and
is willing to sell such a wager for any price >= p units.

Any net that uses early stopping can do better by using dropout
(at the cost od taking longer to train)
